# Bandcamp

Overview:
-	Music platforms like Spotify and Apple Music works on royalty, but for up and rising artist it is not a means to living as they don’t have the volume. Not to mention the royalty calculation is often a black box.

-	Bandcamp is an online music album sales platform with a very transparent and artist friendly payment structure. For every dollar of revenue generated by a sale, the artist will receive 70% of it and remaining goes to Bandcamp.


-	It also operates on a special business model called pay what you want. This was designed so that fans could support their artists by going beyond the minimum price, and essentially giving “tips”




Potential directions of this project:
-	Is there any difference between premium of different countries
-	Is there any difference between premium at different time
-	If the artist set a higher price, will they tend to get a higher % of premium ( for this I need to set proxy for quality of music)
-	forecasting album sales for individual artists
-	recommendation system based on sequential modelling
